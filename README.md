## Instructions

## HTML: 

- Create a header for the navigation bar, complete with buttons or icons for Search, Create, Apps, Notifications, etc.

- Use semantic HTML structure for video entries (e.g., ```<article>, <h3>, <p>```).

- Populate with placeholder text like Talking Tech and AI with Google CEO Sundar Pichai!, Marques Brownlee, 3.4M views · 6 months ago, etc. 

## CSS:

- Style your header (e.g., fixed position, background color).

- Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to layout video thumbnails in responsive rows or columns.

- Style typography and spacing to echo the YouTube aesthetic.

---

## Optional Enhancements

- Make the navigation responsive, collapsing icons on smaller screens.

- Add hover effects—like scaling thumbnails or highlighting video cards.

- Implement a clock icon next to the view count to mimic YouTube’s UI details.

- Swap out placeholder images for real ones or use a placeholder image service.
